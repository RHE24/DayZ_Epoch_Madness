# DayZ Epoch Madness
This is a project for my Private Arma2 DayZ_Epoch 1.0.5.1 server with several mods customized!
<h3><b>Mods I have in this server working:</b></h3>
<ul>
<li><b>Single Currency 3.0 by Zupa</b></li>
<li><b>Plotmanagement</b></li>
<li><b>ESSV2 Custom Spawn points</b></li>
<li><b>Snap Build Pro 1.4 with Build Vetors and Precise Building</b></li>
<li><b>Custom Suicide Scripts Right Click Actions Deploy Bike</b></li>
<li><b>Custom Configured Wicked AI, DZMS, and DZAI</b></li>
</ul>
<b>This server is HARD! It's chanlleging and fun to play on but be fore warned you need freinds to watch your back!</b>
<p>
The mods are a mess and all over the project. 
In the furture I will condence them down to give them a better flow 
on a final release of these sever files.
I took some of the best mods out there, with a lot of people focusing on updates
for Epoch 1.0.6c and the latter. I took the best fixes of these mods for Epoch, back into Epoch 1.0.5.1.
In my humble opinion, Epoch 1.0.6c is really more like the stand alone version of the game DayZ!
The new patch for PC has really no wiggle room for some awesome mods that the community put countless hours into making just to have code and variables almost completely changed just so they can stay up with current releases of the Paid version of DayZ!</p>

<p>Doin a little research on current Arma2 and Arma3 servers that are live with the most population in server demographics, Have mods like Coins single currency, Plotmanagement, Banking, AI, and many more. Thes mods are the key to getting more players playing populated servers and are fun to play on. Who want's to play a game thats fustrating within 10 minutes. 
I played on some of the new epoch 1.0.6c servers and to be honest the most populated ones are ones with moddified mods comming from Epoch 1.0.5.1 foward. Doing a complete rewrite of code just to stay in line with current code changes, is just insane. By the way PC STAND ALONE DAYZ 1.8.8 WORKS JUST FINE WITH EPOCH 1.0.5.1! THATS WHAT I DON"T GET WHY CHANGE EPOCH THE WAY YOU DID!</p>

Ok my rant is over. Enjoy!
