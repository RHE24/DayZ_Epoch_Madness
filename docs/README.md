<b>DayZ_Epoch 1.0.6.1 server with several mods customized!</b>

Since I started this project several months ago, around the release of Epoch 1.0.6 I was still hanging on to the old version 1.0.5.1. Now that Epoch 1.0.6.1C is upon us, I opted to start a fresh new PVE militarized server. This project has some of the best converted mods there are in the community to date. I tried my best to be very careful on this to have no errors either client side or server side.

I enjoy figuring out mods for Epoch! It's become sort of a daily hobby for me. With the stand alone Dayz game and all the confusion some times it's hard to get through all the code when there are problems.

This is a PC based Full server install all you have to do is download this edit the configs for the mods on the server and client side and your all good to go. I try my best to do as much testing on a clean server each time changes are made. So far the project has very minimal errors since switching over to Epoch 1.0.6.1 and to be honest it was easier to get this PVE militarized server up and running than the older version of the Epoch mod.

Again to all those in the community that spent countless hours working on there perspective projects I thank you for giving all of us something nice to play around with and have fun with.

Enjoy!</p>
