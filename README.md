#DayZ Epoch Madness
This is files for my Private DayZ_Epoch 1.0.5.1 server with several mods customized!

This is a mess! Yes a Mess! I need to combine and organize the server mission files better
before a release of this. I took some of the best mods out there with a lot of people focusing on updates
for Epoch 1.0.6c and the latter, and reverted the best fixes back into Epoch 1.0.5.1. Reason being is that

Epoch 1.0.6c is really more like the stand alone version of the game DayZ with really no wiggle room for some
awesome mods that the community put countless hours into making just to have code almost completely changed
and variables changes in a a complete almost re write? C'mon! The game was fun as it was. If you look at some of 
the top server demographics, Coins single currency key changing ect just to name a few make servers more populated
and fun to play on. Who want's to play a game thats fustrating within 10 minutes. I played on some of the new epoch 1.0.6c
server and to be honest the most populated ones are ones with moddified coins and just the same dang mods from 1.0.5.1.

Ok my rant is over. Enjoy!
